This is an Introduction to Quantum Computing using IBM's Qiskit tools, which are linked in the document. It is intended to be used in a 2 hour coding session as part of a summer camp, for undergraduate STEM students who have seen the basics of Python, but not things like lists or iteration, and may not know anything about digital electronics or classical computers.
